#### What

These are the (slide) deck requirements for TEDxBoulder 2017. 

Our goal is to make this as clear and as easy as possible, so you can focus on your idea, and delighting those attending. Below, you’ll find all the details we believe are necessary to craft the digital component of your talk. Once you submit your slides, we’ll work to ensure they meet our expectations; we’ll reach-out with questions or concerns. You focus on amazing our audience, we’ll focus on the details of running the show.

Please submit decks [using this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/request/pE10x7UFnEF7XlS6wKzI). _PS: it’s helpful if you include your name in the file name._ 

For questions or additional needs, please contact Benjamin Chait ([hello@benjaminchait.net](mailto:hello@benjaminchait.net)).

#### Technical details

We use **Keynote** on a **Mac** to run our deck. You are welcome to craft your slides using PowerPoint or Google Slides, but please note they will be converted before the show. 

Slides should be provided in **1024x768 resolution**. Bonus points for higher resolution but the same aspect ratio!

Please do not include a **title slide**. We will handle this ourselves, so every speaker has a standard introduction (typically your name and Twitter handle). Likewise, you do not need a **closing slide**; after your last slide, we transition to black. 

**Video, audio and non-standard fonts**—all are possible but I ask these get submitted sooner rather than later so you and I can verify everything worked correctly. Let me know ASAP if you have video or audio.

**No auto-advancing slides**; you will have a remote clicker to advance each slide.

#### Best practices

Please use **fonts larger than size 48** for visibility at the very back of Macky Auditorium.

**Avoid edge content** on your slides. While we do our best, our projection sometimes clips the edge of the deck, and we don’t want to lose words or other important content. 

Some optional **blank templates** to get you started:

#### The event

* Each speaker will wear **a wireless mic**; we’ll get it to you before you walk on stage and will help remove it once you finish.
* We will have an **on-stage monitor** mirroring the slide deck so you always know what your audience sees, and never need to turn your back to the crowd.
* You’ll have a **wireless clicker** so you can advance slides from the stage.

#### General presentation tips
_We’ve done this a few times…_
* Less is more. More than five lines of text is a lot—simplify, simplify, simplify.
* Let the audience focus on you and not the deck behind you.
* You’ve got an audience of nearly 2,000 people who really care and are fully engaged.
* Keep your transitions simple. We’ve all seen the fancy transitions and effects; I’d honestly say that no added transition is almost always better.
* Your talk needs to be on time; we’ve got a clock near your monitor that gives you your exact time. We’ll start as soon as you say, “Hello!” or “Thank you.”
* Watch TED.com talks to get a sense of what works on slides (or maybe what doesn’t). Seth Godin is a great example of someone augmenting his talks with strong illustrations.
* You might find some great creative-commons photos on Flickr. Please give the appropriate credit as described by the CC licenses.
* [Presentation Zen](http://www.presentationzen.com) is full of great tips.
* Practice. Then do it again.
* Please reach-out if you want help.
